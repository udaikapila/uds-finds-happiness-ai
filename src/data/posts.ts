# Day 1: Setting Off from the Rockies

The morning air was crisp as we loaded our bikes at the trailhead. Our panniers were full—maybe too full—with supplies for the next seven days. Today would be our first real test, a 35-mile route through Rocky Mountain National Park with over 3,000 feet of elevation gain.

## The Climb

The first few miles were deceptively easy, a gentle warm-up along the valley floor. Aspens trembled in the morning breeze, their leaves catching the golden light. But soon we hit the first climb, a relentless 8-mile ascent that had us shifting to our lowest gears.

By midday, we'd reached the alpine meadows. Wildflowers dotted the landscape, and we spotted a small herd of elk in the distance. The thin air at 9,500 feet had us breathing hard, but the views more than made up for the effort.

## Mountain Weather

The afternoon brought our first challenge: dark clouds rolling in from the west. We hurriedly donned rain gear just as the skies opened up. The rain turned the dirt trail into a slick mess, forcing us to walk sections we'd planned to ride.

When we finally made camp at dusk, we were exhausted but exhilarated. The rain had stopped, giving way to a spectacular sunset that painted the mountains in shades of pink and gold.

Tomorrow brings the high alpine pass. We'll need all the rest we can get.

Gear note: The new handlebar bag is working perfectly for quick-access items, but my tent is still a challenge to pack efficiently. Looking forward to refining the setup as we go.

# Day 2: Conquering the High Alpine Pass

Waking up to frost on our tents was a stark reminder of the elevation. The thermometer read 28°F, and our water bottles had partially frozen overnight. After a quick breakfast of oatmeal and strong coffee, we broke camp and began the day's biggest challenge: crossing the Continental Divide at 11,500 feet.

## The Push to the Top

The first few miles were brutal. The trail pitched up steeply, forcing us to push our loaded bikes for nearly an hour. Each step was a battle against gravity and thin air.

By mid-morning, the tree line fell away, revealing a stark, beautiful alpine landscape. Wind-sculpted rocks and hardy alpine flowers dotted the terrain. The final mile to the pass was the steepest yet, but the anticipation of reaching the top kept us moving.

## Continental Divide

Standing at the Continental Divide was surreal. To the east, all water flows to the Atlantic; to the west, the Pacific. The 360-degree views were some of the most spectacular I've ever seen—snow-capped peaks stretching to the horizon in every direction.

We celebrated with chocolate and photos before preparing for the reward: a 12-mile descent dropping nearly 3,000 feet.

## The Descent

The descent was technical in places but mostly pure joy. Flying down the mountainside with the wind in our faces, we covered in 40 minutes what had taken us three hours to climb. The trail eventually merged with an old logging road, allowing us to pick up speed through forests of lodge-pole pine.

We made camp early by a bubbling stream, giving us time to wash clothes and rest our legs. Tomorrow will bring us into drier terrain as we head west.

Equipment note: My knee has been giving me some trouble on the descents. Raising the seat height slightly seems to have helped. The new tubeless tire setup is proving its worth—no flats despite some rocky sections that would have surely punctured tubes.

# Day 3: Transition to Desert Landscapes

The transformation of the landscape today was remarkable. We started in the cool pine forests on the western slopes of the Rockies and gradually descended into a world of red rock, juniper trees, and expansive views.

## Morning Miles

We broke camp at dawn, eager to make miles before the day heated up. The morning trail was fast and flowing, predominantly downhill with occasional short climbs. The forest began to thin, and the air grew noticeably warmer with each mile.

By mid-morning, we'd shed our jackets and arm warmers. The trail surface changed from dark soil to increasingly sandy sections with occasional slickrock. Water became a concern, so we filled all bottles at the last reliable stream crossing.

## Red Rock Country

By noon, we had fully entered red rock country. Towering mesas and bizarre rock formations dominated the horizon. The trail wound through a landscape that felt almost Martian in its otherworldliness.

The heat was intense by early afternoon, climbing well into the 80s. We took a long lunch break in the shade of a massive sandstone overhang, watching lizards dart across the sun-baked ground.

## Afternoon Challenge

The afternoon brought our first mechanical issue of the trip. Sarah's derailleur cable frayed and eventually snapped, leaving her with just two usable gears. We managed a roadside repair that gave her a workable middle gear, but we'll need to find a bike shop within the next day or two.

Despite this setback, the riding was spectacular. The trail followed an ancient indigenous trading route, with faint petroglyphs visible on some rock faces. We spotted a golden eagle soaring on thermals high overhead.

## Desert Camp

We made camp on a flat section of slickrock overlooking a vast canyon. As the sun set, the red rocks glowed as if lit from within, gradually shifting through oranges and purples before fading to deep blue.

The night sky here is incredible—far from any light pollution, the Milky Way stretches horizon to horizon. The temperature is dropping quickly though, reminding us that desert nights can be surprisingly cold.

Tomorrow brings our longest day yet, as we need to reach the small town of Mesa Verde to fix Sarah's bike.

Gear note: Carrying the extra water weight (6 liters each) made the afternoon climbs much more challenging. The silnylon groundsheet is proving invaluable for camping on abrasive surfaces like tonight's slickrock.

# Day 4: Deep into Canyon Country

The morning began with the haunting call of a canyon wren echoing off the sandstone walls. We packed up quickly, knowing today would be our most challenging in terms of water management. The forecast called for temperatures in the low 90s, and our route would take us 50 miles with only one reliable water source halfway.

## Morning Navigation

The trail became less distinct as we entered the canyon system. We relied heavily on GPS and occasional cairns left by previous travelers. The landscape was a maze of interconnected canyons and washes, making navigation a constant challenge.

By mid-morning, we'd entered "The Narrows," a section where the canyon walls closed in to just 10 feet apart, rising hundreds of feet above us. The light played off the striated walls, creating a cathedral-like atmosphere of silent reverence.

## Midday Heat

The promised water source—a spring emerging from the canyon wall—was thankfully flowing well. We filtered enough to fill all our bottles and camelbaks, then sought shade for lunch. The temperature had climbed into the 90s, and the heat radiated from the rock walls.

After lunch, we faced the day's major obstacle: a bike portage up and out of the canyon. The "trail" here was essentially a rock scramble, requiring us to pass bikes up in sections and make multiple trips with our gear. The 300-vertical-foot climb took nearly two hours in the blistering heat.

## Ancient History

The afternoon route followed an ancient indigenous trading path along a high ridge. We passed multiple archaeological sites—granaries tucked into cliff alcoves and faint pictographs depicting bighorn sheep and human figures. The sense of history was palpable; people have traversed these routes for thousands of years.

As the day wore on, fatigue and heat began to take their toll. We rationed our water carefully, taking only small sips as we navigated the increasingly technical trail. The last 10 miles seemed to stretch endlessly as we searched for our planned campsite near a seasonal stream.

## Oasis Camp

Just before sunset, we reached "The Oasis"—a small spring-fed pool surrounded by cottonwood trees. The contrast of vibrant green against the red rock backdrop was startling after a day in the monochromatic desert.

We set up camp as night fell rapidly. The temperature dropped 30 degrees within an hour of sunset, a welcome relief after the scorching day. Dinner was a simple affair of rehydrated chili, followed by a shared bar of dark chocolate.

Tomorrow we'll reach the small outpost of Hanksville, where we hope to resupply and perhaps enjoy a meal we don't have to cook ourselves.

Gear note: The UV water purifier proved its worth today—much faster than filtering the silty spring water. The bike bags held up well to the scrambling and rough handling during the portage section.

# Day 5: Through the Ancient Forest

We woke to the distant rumble of thunder—an unexpected sound in the desert. Dark clouds were building on the western horizon, adding urgency to our morning routine. We needed to reach Hanksville before the storm hit or risk being caught in a flash flood zone.

## Race Against Weather

The trail conditions were perfect after yesterday's heat—hard-packed and fast. We made excellent time through the rolling terrain, constantly checking the approaching storm over our shoulders. The normally blue desert sky had transformed into a dramatic canvas of dark clouds and shafts of golden sunlight breaking through.

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1513836279014-a89f7a76ae86?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1200&h=800" alt="Storm clouds" />

By mid-morning, we'd reached the entrance to the Petrified Forest section of our route. All around us lay the crystallized remains of an ancient forest—trees over 200 million years old transformed into stone, their internal structures replaced by brilliantly colored minerals.

## Geological Wonders

Despite the approaching storm, we couldn't help but stop frequently to examine the petrified logs. Some were massive—four feet in diameter and showing clear growth rings and bark textures. The rainbow of colors was astonishing: jaspers, agates, and crystalline quartz in hues of red, yellow, purple, and blue.

The trail wound through badlands of blue and purple clay hills, a surreal landscape that felt like riding on another planet. In places, the trail was barely visible, marked only by subtle changes in the ground texture.

## The Storm Arrives

We were still 10 miles from Hanksville when the storm caught us. The first fat raindrops quickly became a downpour, and the clay soil instantly transformed into a sticky mess that clogged our tires and drive trains.

Within minutes, riding became impossible. We shouldered our bikes and began a muddy trudge as lightning cracked across the sky. The usually dry washes began to fill with rushing water, forcing us to detour to higher ground.

## Unexpected Shelter

Just as the situation was becoming truly miserable, we spotted a small ranch house in the distance. The property owner, an elderly man named Jim who had lived in the area his entire life, saw us struggling and invited us to wait out the storm in his barn.

Jim turned out to be a fountain of local knowledge. As we dried our gear, he shared stories of the area's history, pointed out routes on our maps that weren't documented, and showed us his collection of fossils and artifacts found on his property.

The storm passed after a couple of hours, but the trails would remain unrideable until morning. Jim generously offered his barn for the night, and we gratefully accepted, hanging our wet gear from the rafters.

Instead of our planned camp meal, we enjoyed an unexpected feast with Jim—fresh baked bread, beef stew, and homegrown vegetables. His hospitality was a powerful reminder of the kindness often found in remote places.

Tomorrow we'll make the delayed journey into Hanksville, resupply, and decide whether to stick to our original route or take one of Jim's suggested alternatives.

Gear note: The sealed bearing hubs have performed flawlessly despite the mud, but both derailleurs will need a thorough cleaning. The waterproof map case proved its worth today—our paper maps and route notes survived completely dry.
